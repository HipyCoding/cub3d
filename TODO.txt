this is the guide i am following: (i found it the most easy to follow so far)
https://hackmd.io/@nszl/H1LXByIE2#Introduction

TODO for juidxin : 
move your lazy albanian ass and do the parsing <3

TODO, after skipping through the guide:

initialize hardcoded testmap, since i am not doing the parsing
ok

player position
ok	1)	pov direction vector based on N/S/E/W
ok	2)	make plane vector perpendicular to direction

basic raycasting structure
ok	1)	calculate ray position and direction
		cam_x = 2 * x / WIDTH; 
		(to make mathematical range of -1 to +1, scaled to our window)
		ray_dir_x = c->player.dir_x + c->player.plane_x * cam_x;
		(e.g. for factor 1, the vector addition would make it the furthest right ray)
		ray_dir_y = c->player.dir_y + c->player.plane_y * cam_x;
		something like this
ok	2)	learn more about DDA
ok	3)	implement DDA
ok	4)	calculate wall distances
ok	5)	wall heights
ok	6)	draw vertical strips based on calculations

render environment
ok	1)	since y=0 is at top, start with ceiling
	2)	implement textures for different directions (NSEW)
	3)	find a way to scale textures
	4)	draw floor

implement player movement
ok	1)	WASD for movement
		player.pos = player.pos + (player.dir * speed)
		something like this, so we dont move in lightspeed
	2)	arrow keys for rotation
		i think this will be harder than movement
	3)	put in wall collision
